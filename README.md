# Candy Factory Menu
A small project to serve as a template for applications using the ConsoleMenu python package

## This project is useful when...
you need a MENU but you are not willing to drop down a full (and very timeconsuming) GUI application inside your python project.

Here it is how it looks on my computer. Feel free to copy and learn from this project :)

## Instructions
Just run "main.py" with python3 and the consolemenu package installed on your machine.

I highly encourage you to go the consolemenu package's source page. There you can find installation instructions for the package and very useful examples inside the "examples" folder.
